Predicting population growth is a complex and important task that has numerous applications in fields such as resource management, conservation, and public health. In this study, we compare three differential equation-based models that are commonly used to describe population growth: the logistic model, the geometric model, and the Lotka-Volterra model. The logistic model assumes that population growth is limited by carrying capacity, the geometric model assumes exponential growth without any limiting factors, and the Lotka-Volterra model is a predator-prey model that describes the interactions between two species in an ecosystem.


Problem formulation: Differential equation-based models are a powerful tool for predicting population growth, but it is not always clear which model is the most accurate or appropriate for a given situation. There are many different factors that can influence population growth, including environmental conditions, resource availability, and interactions with other species, and different models may make different assumptions about these factors. This study aims to compare the performance of three popular differential equation-based models for predicting population growth and to identify the strengths and limitations of each model.

Research goals: The main goals of this study are to:


1. Compare the accuracy of the Logistic, Geometric, and Lotka-Volterra models in predicting population growth under different conditions.
2. Identify the key assumptions and parameters of each model and how they influence the predictions.
3. Determine the suitability of each model for different types of population dynamics and applications.
4. Propose guidelines for selecting the appropriate model for a given situation.


To achieve these goals, we will use a combination of analytical methods, numerical simulations, and real-world data to test the performance of each model. We will also consider the implications of our findings for resource management, conservation, and public health. Overall, this study will provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different differential equation-based models for predicting population growth and help researchers and practitioners to choose the most appropriate model for a given situation.
